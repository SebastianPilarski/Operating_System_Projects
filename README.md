# Operating System Projects

Several operating system related projects:

[Shadowed File System:](Shadow_File_System/)
In this project, I developed a Shadowing File System that allows one to commit and restore several states of the filesystem to disk - similarly to Time Machine by Apple. It functions on a virtual disk, and allows for opening, closing, and deleting files. Users can also seek read and write pointers, write, read, and get file size.  

[Simple Shell:](Simple_Shell/)
Here, I made a simple unix shell that runs in the console. It is capable of piping, redirecting, signal interrupts, and various built-in functions such as cd, pwd, exit.

[Memory Key-Value Store](Key_Value_Store/)
This project is an implemented store. It features an api that allows writing key-value pairs to a store, reading individiual values per key sequentially, reading all values from a key at once, as well as creation and deletion of a store.
